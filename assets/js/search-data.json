Proposals to BUY: 54 CBOE, at the Market . 5-Year fair value per share around $207 (148% ROI) | . 37 CME, at the Market. . 5-Year fair value per share around $422 (153% ROI) | . Sell: . BRK.B - Berkshire hathaway - all held, at the market NKE - - all held, at the market . Reasons: BRK.B - Not innovative, Not a good time for insurance ,Big polluter, Warren buffet will die soon . Reasons: NKE - We want to sell nike because it has more than doubled since we bought it, we figure the cash is more useful for rebalancing and the stock has far surpassed our fair value appraisals. . Vote: Yes: 4 No: 1 Abstain: 1 . The club APPROVES the above portfolio actions . PART 1: Report . Business Description . CME Group: CME Group Inc. is a global markets company. It is the world&#39;s largest financial derivatives exchange, and trades in asset classes that include agricultural products, currencies, energy, interest rates, metals, and stock indexes. (wikipedia) . CBOE Group: The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), located at 400 South LaSalle Street in Chicago, is the largest U.S. options exchange with annual trading volume that hovered around 1.27 billion contracts at the end of 2014.[1] CBOE offers options on over 2,200 companies, 22 stock indices, and 140 exchange-traded funds (ETFs). . Industry Overview &amp; Competitive Positioning . Companies in the exchange services industry facilitate market making operations for their constituents. Companies within this sub-industry normally own a number of exchanges that list a wide variety of investment vehicles. Some of these more traditional products are things like US Equities, corporate bonds, and government notes. Exchanges also tend to list products that help investors gain exposure to the broader capital structure. This could be index futures, options contracts, commodity and sector-specific ETFs, ect. . Operating an exchange requires immense upfront costs, and the market structure of the sector generally resembles some form of oligarchy. CME has a large degree of pricing and monopoly power when it comes to futures markets, while CBOE has the cost advantage in the options market. Together these firms have an effective monopoly on the supply of speculation tools to stock market investors. Oftentimes these products are vital to hedging portfolios, a sort of insurance strategy that many employ in an attempt to curtail and control risk. . Investment Summary . CBOE and CME would help lower the general volatility in our holdings. A beta value that is less than 1.0 means that the security is theoretically less volatile than the market. Our portfolio average beta is around 1, so while we do not have more volatile returns than the index, the addition of these firms might help stabilize our returns in the future. . CBOE and CME can battle cyclicality by making money when equities perform poorly. These companies make money by existing where money flows between buyers and sellers, and their toplines are a function of how much trading is going on which is less directly tied to credit market risk than other financial institution balance sheets. This provides nice cyclical protection since the broader market might be selling off, but during periods of large declines, or increased volatility, we tend to see more volume (more shares being bought and sold in total in a given period). . CBOE and CME would increase our financial services exposure without being tied to a bank. Although the contraction from the coronavirus shock may continue to weigh on economic growth, and a double dip or more prolonged contraction is in the cards, we think financial services are a staple to the domestic economy, especially companies that exist at the intersect of markets and technology, and will continue to find opportunities for growth over the course of the next expansion. . Investment Risks . Because CME &amp; CBOE rely on the liquidity of the counterparty&#39;s in the transactions they facilitate, if investors are illiquid, there will likely be less commissions to collect. . CBOE has a high PEG ratio (how expensive a stock is relative to its expected earnings growth) which might indicate that it is not growing its earnings enough to justify recent price increases. . CME &amp; CBOE have also seen declining market shares in recent years as technology lowers the barriers to entry for new clearing houses, however due to the dominance and institutionalization of contracts like Eminis (CME) and Bitcoin futures (CBOE), we believe that these companies will generally have the upper hand in implementing innovations and novel products. . Corporate Governance &amp; Sustainability . CME boasts that their corporate governance values are ethical and responsible. There are fair workers rights for all members and stakeholders. CBOE offers committee transparency by releasing press reports that include its own sources to improve investor relations. . CME ESG Risk : 15 on Yahoo Finance - 7th Percentile of all stocks . CBOE ESG Risk: 20 - 25h Percentline . Valuation . Our scenario analysis implies that as long as revenues grow at least by 6% per year, we will see lofty returns on investment. .

Recommendation: . We recommend a BUY on BKNG. We expect volatility to continue over the next two weeks; therefore, we would like to use a tailored entry to capitalize on these movements. We propose placing a limit order for three shares of BKNG at 1000 dollars per share. We want to place a stop BUY at 1400 dollars per share. For those who dont know what that means: we would not buy BKNG unless it hit 1000 or 1400 dollars per share. . Thesis . Bookings Holdings is a quality company trading almost 50% off of 52-Week Highs. We believe that BKNG wins coming out of this recession and currently attractive at these prices on a relative and DCF valuation basis. We think that BKNG&#39;s period of rapid revenue growth approaches an end, however, after a massive decline in revenues this year, we anticipate BKNG converging back to a steady 2% revenue growth rate over ten years. . Why Now: The Coronavirus impacted and continues to impact the economy at an unprecedented level. Unlike the Great Depression, the Great Recession and other recessions, the Coronavirus upheaval has brought the global economy to a full halt. Economic indicators over the next few weeks will likely be some of the worst readings in the history of US economic account records. But under the presumption that the crises will eventually end, either through a vaccine or herd immunity, we decided to explore the wreckage that is the travel industry in search of pockets of value and mispriced names. Staying away from airlines, we turned to travel intermediaries and hospitality stocks and settled on a peer sample of companies who leverage technology. . | Why Bookings: Bookings would complement our portfolio as a multibillion-dollar, global, US-based technology company with many subsidiaries, including Booking.com, Priceline.com, Agoda.com, Kayak.com, Cheapflights, Rentalcars.com, Momondo, and OpenTable. They have a reputation for market dominance in hotel bookings. Additionally, Bookings aggressively expanded their operations using their fluency in information technology and hospitality to include restaurant reservations systems internationally. Bookings earnings have steadily increased in the past, and have room to continue as they expand. . | Why Bookings now: Models, incorporating worst-case scenarios for economic slowdowns, predict not only Bookings&#39; survival as a company due to high margins, but also future growth. The consistent revenue they bring in as a dynamic company sustains the company through black swan events like the Coronavirus while maintaining positive outlooks for the future. As an online intermediary for travelers, hotels, and restaurants, Bookings&#39;s exposure is lower than other hospitality industries that had sold off recently, such as airlines, cruise lines, amusement parks, hotels, and food services. They have fewer employees and have the technological flexibility to afford periods of stagnation in development. BKNG is trading at historically low prices compared to fundamental value and presents a significant opportunity to add a travel industry behemoth to our portfolio and take advantage of the extreme pessimism, and volatility equity markets are currently experiencing. . | . Brief Industry Overview . Traveling requires planning trips; not too long ago, consumers relied on travel agencies to serve that function. Technology made that obsolete by allowing consumers to plan their travels. With the rise of the internet and social media, consumers can access information, decide where they want to go and compare prices themselves. They also have more modes of transportation via ride-sharing apps, higher volume, and scope of airline flights in general improvements in global infrastructure. . These technological advancements create more efficient markets for travelers and do most of the heavy lifting when it comes to contract matching and sales. It is no wonder that Tourism, hospitality, and circularly, industries have newfound reliance on information technology. . Bookings provide much of this information in one place, on any of their given websites. Travel technology demand by consumers and businesses rises along with new applications for travel technology. This demand is mainly satisfied with Bookings, the largest travel technology company in the world. . Brief Peer Overview . Bookings&#39; competitors include Expedia, Trip.com, and TripAdvisor. Expedia with a market cap of 8.8B includes CarRentals.com, Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Orbitz and Travelocity. Trip.com with a cap of 13.8B includes Airfarewatchdog, Bookingbuddy.com, Holidaylettings.co.uk, and Jetsetter.com. TripAdvisor, with a market cap of 2.4B receives a significant portion of their revenue from Bookings and Expedia. For comparison, Bookings has a market cap of $51.5B. Bookings outperforms its competitors in almost all performance markers. . Business Description . Booking Holdings Inc. provides online travel and related services in Europe, North America, South America, the Asia-Pacific region, the Middle East, and Africa. The company operates Booking.com, which connects travelers with a selection of places to stay, including apartments, vacation homes, family-run B&amp;Bs, 5-star luxury resorts, tree houses, and igloos; and KAYAK that searches other sites to show travelers the information they need to find the right flights, hotels, rental cars, and vacation packages. It also operates Priceline, an online travel deal service, which provides travelers to save on hotel rooms, airline tickets, rental cars, vacation packages, and cruises; Agoda, which provides online accommodation reservation services. In addition, the company operates Rentalcars.com that offers online rental car reservation services; and OpenTable, an online provider of restaurant reservation and information services to consumers and restaurant reservation management, as well as customer acquisition services to restaurants. Further, it offers travel insurance products. The company was formerly known as The Priceline Group Inc. and changed its name to Booking Holdings Inc. in February 2018. Booking Holdings Inc. was founded in 1997 and is headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut. (Source: Finviz) . Revenue Drivers . Agency, merchant and advertising operations drive Bookings&#39; revenue. Their main source of revenue comes from acting as an online travel agency booking hotels, car rentals and restaurant reservations with commissions. Their second source derives from their role as a merchant, selling reservations at hotels, car rentals and restaurant reservations. Bookings also receives revenue from traditional advertising on it&#39;s websites. . Sustainability and Governance . Yahoo ESG rating is 19/100, quantified using data of 120 environmental, social and governance indicators including: carbon emissions, climate change effect, pollution, waste disposal, renewable energy, resource depletion, supply chain, political contributions, discrimination, diversity, community relations, human rights, cumulative voting, executive compensation, shareholders&#39; rights, takeover defense, staggered boards, and independent directors. ESG rating will penalize companies for &quot;missing data.&quot; A low score signals less risk in governance and social-environmental impact. The anti-competitive nature of Bookings indicates its success as a capitalist company as much as their disrespect for fair play in markets. Business informs Bookings political opinions, evidenced by their support for the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestine. . Risks . The beautiful thing about this idea is the company is experiencing a worst-case scenario. Economic activity will grind to a halt, and revenues will be impacted. We expect BKNG&#39;s revenues to decline modestly, and the DCF models account for this in the 60% decline in topline built into the first year. One risk might be that recent events might change consumer behavior in the travel sector, and revenue streams might be dampened for the foreseeable future. Additionally, more than half of revenues are reservations and travel insurance--massive amounts of travel insurance claims might drain cash flows in ways our models do not anticipate. .",

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
